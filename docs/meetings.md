# Meetings

How to hold remote meetings that are effective and productive.

## Checklist for team leaders

### Choose your meeting software

* Look for functionality that meets your needs.

    * Video and audio functions

    * Screen sharing

    * Recording

    * Breakout rooms

    * Security (including encryption)  


* Make sure everyone is using the same tool.

* Hold some basic training sessions to give teams an introduction to the chosen tool and best practices.

## Checklist for teams

### Schedule meetings thoughtfully

* Use a scheduling tool or shared calendar feature to check others’ availability.

* Add your own working hours and availability in your online calendar.

* Send invitations through the shared meeting calendar your team is using, so the meeting will appear directly on guests’ calendars and not only in their email. 

* RSVP promptly to all calendar invitations so people can plan accordingly. If you can’t attend a specific instance of a recurring meeting, decline for that specific instance.

* If you need to cancel a meeting, delete the calendar event **and** notify all guests (most platforms have this as a feature).

* Make calendar invitations editable by all guests to decentralize meeting logistics.

* Differentiate between invitees who need to be at the meeting and those whose attendance is optional.

### Prepare ahead of time

* Prepare an agenda in an editable document and share with people who will attend.

    * Key talking points and how long you plan to spend on each one

    * Members that will be in attendance

    * What each person is responsible for contributing to the meeting

    * Relevant files, links, research, etc.

    * Action items will be added during the meeting

* Add the shared meeting agenda document (and other relevant materials) in the calendar link so everyone can access it in advance.

* Provide a dial-in option for guests who won’t be able to use video.

### Stay on task

* Take shared notes during the meeting -- everyone adds their own notes and action items to ensure accuracy and equal distribution of note-taking responsibility.

* Adhere to the predetermined agenda or structure for the meeting, and sidebar other conversations for another time.

* Make sure every person knows their role and responsibility for the meeting. If they don’t have one, they may not need to attend.

* Before ending the meeting, make sure everyone knows:

    * Action items and who will do them

    * When deliverables are due

    * Logistics for the next meeting

### Use meeting tools effectively

* Default to keeping your video on during meetings, if at all possible. Meetings are faster and more productive when people can use non-verbal cues.

* If you’re having trouble hearing someone in a meeting, stop them using visual cues (e.g., raise your hand or point to your ear). Don’t wait until they finish talking.

* Mute when you are not speaking.

* Use the meeting chat feature to add supporting comments or side questions.

* If you have connectivity issues during the meeting, try:

    * Adjusting video quality settings ([example](https://support.google.com/a/users/answer/9302964?co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid&hl=en#adjust-video-quality) from Google Meet)

    * Turning off video

    * Dialing in

### Show respect to others

* Show up on time and end on time.

* Start with introductions if some guests don’t know others.

* Refer to the shared agenda document to make sure everyone’s items are addressed.

* Don’t stare at your phone or be obviously distracted while others are presenting.

* To make sure quiet people get heard, "pass" the conversation in a way that allows everyone time to speak.

###  Make space to be human

* Schedule meetings with a little time to spare at the end (e.g., 25 instead of 30 min) to allow people to transition or take small breaks.

* Encourage some small talk at the beginning of the meeting to foster connection among distributed team members.

* Normalize human activities that must sometimes happen during remote calls (i.e., eating, getting a package delivery, dealing with interruptions by children). People should feel comfortable to do these things while on mute.

### Avoid having too many meetings

* Document work and status updates in a central location so anyone can review asynchronously without the need for a meeting.

* Block time in your schedule for "focused work" as a calendar event -- preventing others from scheduling meetings on top of it.

* Cancel recurring meetings when they are no longer productive or necessary.

* **Do not** schedule meetings for status updates or quick questions -- first, see if you can find out by pinging someone in chat or checking the Single Source of Truth.

* **Do** schedule structured meetings for specific, [predetermined purposes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xrBPTGR_7R5FCGja-p2rXaMcN4NAjuE_6pKqPcYwOvQ/edit#heading=h.oq42u020vcc).
