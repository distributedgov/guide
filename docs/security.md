# Security

## Checklist for team leaders

### Establish policies and processes

* Review telework agreements and policies to ensure they comply with your agency’s information security policies.

* Create a clear, written data handling policy that accounts for realities of working outside a physical office (e.g., working on the laptop in view of family members).

* Enforce personal privacy requirements for records.

* Keep all policies accessible in a place where everyone knows to look for them (like Confluence or other team collaboration tool).

* Track removal and return of potentially sensitive materials, such as personnel records.

### Enforce secure login practices

* Choose a [password manager](https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/best-password-managers/) and make sure teams adopt it for secure, unique passwords across all logins.

* Enforce [two-factor authentication](https://medium.com/@mshelton/two-factor-authentication-for-beginners-b29b0eec07d7) across agency systems and employee logins.

* Provide training on use of password management and two-factor authentication (this can be a simple half-day workshop to onboard everyone to the tools and practice using them).

* Explicitly forbid the use of passwords written on sticky notes or browser auto-fill passwords for agency system logins.

### Ensure secure systems access for teams

* Set up a Virtual Private Network ([VPN](https://www.howtogeek.com/133680/htg-explains-what-is-a-vpn/)) for secure internet connection, and confirm that your employees can access it from their homes.

* Make sure the right employees can securely login and access systems remotely (this can mean expanding access for some employees and limiting it for others).

* Consider reimbursing employees if they need to use their mobile hotspot for remote systems access.

### Provide security training

* Information systems security training (can be provided by third-party vendor)

* Workshops for setting up and using password manager and two-factor authentication

* Training on recognizing and avoiding phishing attacks (here’s a [simple quiz](https://phishingquiz.withgoogle.com/) you can use to test employee awareness)

## Checklist for teams

### Beware of phishing / malware / hacking

* Emails that ask you to confirm personal information

* Email addresses or websites that don’t look genuine

* High-intensity subject lines or messaging (i.e., "Urgent COVID Directive!")

* Don’t open attachments you don’t recognize

### Use secure login practices

* Onboard to the password manager tool your team is using

* Set an example to others if your team isn’t collectively using a password manager (and perhaps offer to lead a one-hour workshop to help colleagues get set up)

* Avoid browser password autofill or writing passwords on sticky notes

### Protect your devices and hardware

* Enable remote lock-out and re-set on your phone / laptop

* Require password entry on power-up and login

* Close laptop and remove CAC / PIV card when not in use

* Encrypt hard disks (and wipe disks before giving away or discarding)

* Never leave devices in the car or out of your sight

* Lock your doors when you leave the house

* Don’t use a thumb drive unless you know where it came from

### Practice good security habits

* Comply with organizational policies and with any additional requirements spelled out in your telework agreement.

* Use only your agency services and tools for email, file sharing, and other work activities -- not your personal accounts. 

* Avoid unsecured WiFi in public places when working on sensitive information (mobile phone hotspot is also not entirely secure). Use agency [VPN](https://www.howtogeek.com/133680/htg-explains-what-is-a-vpn/) for secure connection.

* Keep software and systems up-to-date -- the latest version will always have the best security fixes. This includes:

    * Cell phone operating system

    * Web browser

    * Laptop / computer operating system

    * Web tools and apps (video conferencing, etc.)
