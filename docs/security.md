How to securely conduct government work as a distributed team.

## Checklist for team leaders

* Review telework agreements and policies to ensure they comply with your agency’s information security policies (and resolve any discrepancies).

* Create a clear, written data handling policy that accounts for realities of working outside a physical office (e.g., working on the laptop in view of family members).

* Set up a Virtual Private Network ([VPN](https://www.howtogeek.com/133680/htg-explains-what-is-a-vpn/)) for secure internet connection, and confirm that your employees can access it from their homes.

* Choose a [password manager tool](https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/best-password-managers/) and make sure teams adopt it for secure, unique passwords across all logins (and provide training on how to use it).

* Make sure the right employees can securely login and access systems remotely (this can mean expanding access for some employees and limiting it for others).

* Provide periodic information systems security training.

* Invest in technology and equipment that can support secure remote work success.

* Enforce [multifactor authentication](https://medium.com/@mshelton/two-factor-authentication-for-beginners-b29b0eec07d7) across agency systems and employee logins.

* Track removal and return of potentially sensitive materials, such as personnel records.

* Train employees to recognize and avoid phishing attacks (here’s a [simple quiz](https://phishingquiz.withgoogle.com/) you can use to test employee awareness)

* Enforce personal privacy requirements for records.

## Checklist for teams

* Comply with organizational policies and with any additional requirements spelled out in your telework agreement.

* Onboard to the password manager tool your team is using

    * Set an example to others if your team isn’t collectively using a password manager

    * Avoid browser password autofill or writing passwords on sticky notes

* Keep your software and systems up-to-date (on phone, browser, and computers).

* Beware of [phishing](https://staysafeonline.org/blog/5-ways-spot-phishing-emails/):

    * Emails that ask you confirm personal information

    * Email addresses or website links that don’t look genuine

    * High-intensity subject lines or messaging (i.e., "urgent COVID directive")

    * Suspicious attachments -- don’t open them

* Avoid unsecured WiFi in public places when working on sensitive information (mobile phone hotspot is also not entirely secure). Use agency [VPN](https://www.howtogeek.com/133680/htg-explains-what-is-a-vpn/) for secure connection.

* Use only your agency services and tools for email, file sharing, and other work activities -- not your personal accounts. 

* Use best security practices for laptops and mobile devices you are using for work:

    * Enable remote lock-out and re-set

    * Require password on power-up and login

    * Close laptop and remove CAC / PIV card when not in use

    * Encrypt hard disks (and wipe disks before giving away or discarding)

    * Never leave devices in the car or out of your sight when traveling

    * Don’t use thumb drives unless you know where they came from
