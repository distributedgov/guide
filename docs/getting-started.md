# Getting started

How to effectively transition from co-located to a distributed team.

## Checklist for team leaders

### Establish policies and permissions

* Obtain written approval (if necessary) for employees to work from home.

* Read your agency’s [telework policy](https://www.businessnewsdaily.com/7749-create-telecommuting-policy.html) or establish one if needed.

* Read — and revise, if needed — the security policy regarding telework activities.

* Create policy on what equipment will be provided / reimbursed by the agency.

### Set up tech infrastructure

* Identify technical pain points of any employees who have already tried working remotely, and make a plan to address these issues first.

* Set up a Virtual Private Network ([VPN](https://www.howtogeek.com/133680/htg-explains-what-is-a-vpn/)), if required, and confirm that your employees can access it from their homes.

* Run load tests to ensure your VPN and other services can handle a sudden uptick as workers access on-premise and cloud applications from remote locations.

* For your tech employees, make sure critical services like source control, build pipelines, and dev/test/prod environments are available remotely.

* Scale and automate tech infrastructure as needed

### Re-consider roles and responsibilities

* Identify which employees need to remain in the office to do tasks that require access to specific on-site equipment.

* Set up workflows to ensure that employees in the office are not required to handle remote employees’ regular assignments (i.e., answering phone calls to desk phones).

### Ensure employees have the right equipment

* Access to high speed internet at home (or ability to tether from mobile device)

* Laptop or computer

* Headset / earbuds and webcam for video conferencing

* Schedule training or instruction to help teams use remote collaboration tools effectively and independently.

* Determine a policy to reimburse employees for certain remote office expenses.

### Set up regular touchpoints

* Schedule daily check-in calls for teams via video conferencing

* Schedule virtual office hours/times when people can ask you questions

### Adopt digital tools for paper-based tasks

* Eliminate the requirement for physical paperwork wherever possible

* For the long term, consider launching a project for ‘going paperless’

* Document signing: [Docusign](https://www.docusign.com/) or other [electronic signature app](https://blog.quoteroller.com/docusign-competitors-and-alternatives/)

* Virtual faxes: [Free online fax services](https://www.lifewire.com/free-fax-services-2378048)

### Set measurable expectations

* Establish work assignment logs or other tracking tools to provide specific and attainable performance expectations for all employees — those in the office *and* remote workers.

* Maintain signed copies of any checklists or agreements (e.g., Employee Safety Checklist, Team Agreement, Telework Assignment Logs, etc.)

* Remember that you won’t be able to measure and track every detail, nor should you try — instead, adopt processes that allow the work to speak for itself and build a culture of trust. 

## Checklist for teams

### Know your agency’s policies and procedures

* Security and data handling procedures (get clear, written guidance)

* Telework Policy

* Team Agreements

* Employee Safety Policy

* Telework Assignment Logs (or similar tracking procedures)

* Request changes to your agency’s policies if you see areas for improvement (and find other agencies you can point to as examples)

### Run experiments before leaving the office

* Work from a different desk / room to identify any paper files you may need (then consider whether those files can be digitized).

* Identify and bookmark key URLs for systems needed in your daily work.

* Use a cell phone hotspot to test network access, and consider whether you need to make changes to your cell phone data plan.

* Confirm working phone / e-mail access to your agency’s IT helpdesk.

### Set up your remote work environment

* Dedicate a desk or working space in your home.

    * Background (for video conferencing) should be free of clutter or other people

    * Surrounding noises and distractions should be minimized

* Consider how you will handle the management of kids or others in your care.

* Consider your internet connection speed and make adjustments if bandwidth is an issue.

* Be flexible when your remote environment does not work perfectly — allow for a learning curve for yourself and others.

### Set up your remote work tools / technology

* Working laptop or computer, headset / earbuds, and webcam for video calls

* Onboard to video conferencing platform that your team has chosen

* Onboard to team chat / collaboration tools that your team has chosen

* Onboard to project management / document sharing tools your team has chosen

### Set up your online calendar

* Make sure there is a link to a video call in every calendar invitation

* Schedule a virtual ‘coffee’ with a co-worker to practice with video calls

* Schedule a recurring social call — perhaps on Fridays — to strengthen your connections with co-workers and remember that you like each other as humans (see [Culture](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xrBPTGR_7R5FCGja-p2rXaMcN4NAjuE_6pKqPcYwOvQ/edit#heading=h.co7z165sjr2m)).

### Set a daily routine

* Get up, dress professionally, make coffee, walk the dog — keeping your usual workday habits will prepare your mind to ‘get to work’.

* Schedule intentional breaks to get up and move throughout the day for mental and physical health.

* Set agreed-upon working hours with your team, then stick to them — avoid the temptation to keep working because there is no ‘office’ to leave at the end of the day.

* If you’re caring for kids or fulfilling other responsibilities in addition to work, write those obligations into your work calendar so you can honor your priorities.
