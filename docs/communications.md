# Communications

Communication strategies to help distributed teams work together effectively.

## Checklist for team leaders

### Set standards for team communications

* Determine what tools will be used universally among team members (email, chat, etc.)

* Designate which tools are used for what purpose

* Agree on expected response times for various comms channels during work hours

* Empower asynchronous communication through collaboration tools 

### Establish regular touchpoints for teams

* Recurring all-hands calls (weekly/monthly)

    * Teamwide updates

    * Informal training / information sharing

* Daily check-in on video call for teams working together often

    * What I did yesterday

    * What I’m doing tomorrow

    * Blockers / questions / action items

* Regular retrospectives of projects or internal efforts

    * What went well

    * What could be better

    * Action items / what we’ll do next time

### Foster human relationships

* Establish online calls that encourage human connection

    * Weekly topic-based social calls for small groups of employees

    * "Virtual coffee" for two or three employees to connect

    * "Virtual happy hour" or similar end-of-week team gathering

* Encourage video-by-default for online meetings

* Set group chat channels that prompt non-work conversations

    * #appreciations / #celebrations / etc.

    * #pets / #parenting / #gardening / #health / etc.

## Checklist for teams

### Work in the open

* Establish a "Single Source of Truth" to document and centralize information

* Update tickets and documentation continuously

* Err on the side of over-communication vs. under-communication

* Default to public channels in group chat so knowledge is shared

* Share drafts and information early and often

* Use collaborative ways of working (i.e., shared note-taking document 

* CC relevant people in emails, but be clear about whether a response is expected (and from whom)

### Communicate with empathy

* Assume best intentions

* Ask clarifying questions / seek additional context

* Be clear about what you need

    * Clear = "I have a non-urgent question about…"

    * Unclear = "Hey, are you busy?"

* Give recognition and appreciation often

* Recognize that conflict and tension are normal -- seek to identify the root cause

### Employ best practices for group chat

* Use "threading" to keep conversations tidy and easy to follow

* Use notification settings to cut down unnecessary noise (snooze, mute channels, Do Not Disturb, etc.)

* Use status to indicate your availability (away for lunch, vacation, caring for kids, etc.) 

* Create channels for groups or topics 

* Use group chat for:

    * Social conversations / interesting links

    * Quick questions / clarifications

    * Real-time exchanges with folks in your timezone

    * General announcements

* Don’t use group chat for:

    * High-level conversations

    * Big decisions

    * In-depth feedback
