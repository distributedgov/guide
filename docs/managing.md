How to effectively lead remote/telework teams.

## Checklist

### Create a culture of trust

* Set expectations for [working in the open](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xrBPTGR_7R5FCGja-p2rXaMcN4NAjuE_6pKqPcYwOvQ/edit#heading=h.iu6i8nhexqyj) so the whole team is accountable to each other -- and hold yourself to the same standard.

* Make sure your telework policies and team agreements focus on outcomes and results, not just time spent working.

* Be vulnerable and human with your team -- show them by example that it’s okay to struggle with a problem or ask a question.

### Set expectations and norms

* Establish work assignment logs or other tracking tools to provide specific and attainable performance expectations for all employees — those in the office *and* remote workers.

* Create and write down team agreements to establish baselines for things like:

    * Appropriate response times for different [communication channels](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xrBPTGR_7R5FCGja-p2rXaMcN4NAjuE_6pKqPcYwOvQ/edit#heading=h.lzbeffnfvqad)

    * When to use email vs. group chat vs. other tools

    * [Remote meeting](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xrBPTGR_7R5FCGja-p2rXaMcN4NAjuE_6pKqPcYwOvQ/edit#heading=h.mhc69d4guwpe) etiquette

    * How to submit work, track time, ask questions

### Empower your team

* Acknowledge challenges out loud (via group chat, video call, etc.) and give your team a safe platform to talk about any strain they are experiencing.

* Normalize failure and encourage people to acknowledge and learn from their mistakes. This will not make your teams fail more, it will empower them to succeed.

* Encourage "distributed leadership" -- rather than trying to micromanage everything, allow natural leaders to emerge and let teams self-organize when they are comfortable doing so.

### Over-communicate

* Make sure policies, plans, and other important documents are easily accessible to teams through a "[Single Source of Truth](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xrBPTGR_7R5FCGja-p2rXaMcN4NAjuE_6pKqPcYwOvQ/edit#heading=h.xys8wwauimls)" or central location.

* Use multiple channels to communicate important information (i.e., email, group chat, video call announcement).

* Hold virtual "office hours" where anyone can drop by with a question or concern.

* Schedule regular All Hands calls where you can share updates with the whole team, or invite team members to present on their projects.

* Establish regular check-ins for project updates or smaller teams:

    * What I did yesterday

    * What I’m working on today

    * Questions / concerns / action items

### Understand everyone’s context

* Take some time to learn about various work styles and communication styles and how they will affect each individual’s remote work approach.

* Be aware of cultural differences that may affect distributed team dynamics (i.e., speaking up to participate in the conversation vs. remaining silent on video calls)

* During check-ins with direct reports, specifically ask about any concerns they have, and see how you can support them.

### Build human connection

* Schedule topic-based social video calls to build connection and camaraderie for team members (i.e., favorite movies, funny pet stories, family traditions).

* Develop remote rituals for celebrating with the team and acknowledging contributions.

* Create virtual spaces for "water cooler" and non-work interactions (i.e., group chat channels focused on music, gardening, or other commonly shared interests).

* Encourage everyone to take a few minutes at the beginning of virtual meetings to acknowledge "humanness" by asking about the other person’s day, weekend plans, or other topics of general interest.
