# Project management

How to effectively manage tasks and projects in remote/telework teams.

## Checklist

### Prioritize collaboration

* Invite feedback early and often by sharing drafts, works-in-progress, and [MVP](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/mvp/)s. Don’t wait until something is "done" to find out if it’s the right thing.

* Iterate on feedback that is given, and repeat the cycle to build trust with collaborators.

* Use tools that allow for simultaneous and asynchronous collaboration.

* Invite ideas from everywhere -- team members, stakeholders, and customers should all be able to "submit a bug" or “suggest a feature”.

### Keep the work visible

* Share product roadmaps and team plans as openly as possible, so people can refer to them at any time to get aligned.

* Document everything in a "[Single Source of Truth](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xrBPTGR_7R5FCGja-p2rXaMcN4NAjuE_6pKqPcYwOvQ/edit#heading=h.xys8wwauimls)" that contains all the information, deadlines, reports, and links for the project so knowledge is shared.

* Use [project tracking software](#heading=h.xg73hzgx2e8i) that allows the team to follow along as tasks are completed (this is helpful for any kind of project, not just software development.)

* For software projects, keep the documentation close to the code (or written into it).

### Have the whole team ‘act’ distributed

* If you have some employees in the office and some remote, have everyone use the same online project management tools so people stay aligned.

* Have all team members use video conferencing for meetings, not just the teleworkers.

* Have everyone add their working hours, availability, and timezones to their calendars and group chat profiles.

* Set team agreements for response times for different channels (i.e., group chat, email, project tickets) so people know when a quick answer is expected, and when it’s not.

### Foster human connection and accountability

* Celebrate project "wins" by hosting virtual happy hours or pizza parties.

* Write appreciation into your project management practices (e.g., start retrospectives by acknowledging each team member’s contributions).

* Make it a rule to assume best intentions, as virtual communications can be more easily misinterpreted than face-to-face talks.

* Let your team know that mistakes happen, and openly acknowledging them is encouraged.

### Be a servant leader

* Instead of asking when something will be done, ask if there are blockers you can help clear.

* Set expectations and give teams the tools to track and submit their work openly. 

* Choose trust over surveillance -- allow people the space and flexibility to get their work done on their own terms, within agreed-upon timelines.

* Encourage question asking. Clarity is exponentially more important in distributed teams.

* Set up "office hours" where anyone can drop by with a question or to brainstorm solutions.

* Assign a [DRI](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/directly-responsible-individuals/) (Directly Responsible Individual) for each part of the project, so everyone knows who is responsible for what.

### Keep lines of communication open

* Hold daily check-ins with project teams to quickly get the latest information:

    * What I worked on yesterday

    * What I’m working on today

    * Questions / blockers / action items

* Have the team put questions and updates in group channels so knowledge is shared.

* Maintain a "risk register" where anyone can view potential risks throughout the project.

* Set standards and "rules of engagement" for dealing with tensions and conflict.

### Reflect and improve

* Use retrospectives to reflect as a group on how a project or process could be improved.

    * What do we appreciate about each member of the group?

    * What is going well?

    * What could be better?

    * Action items for moving forward

* Run "tool-checks" by asking team members for feedback on the tools you are using for remote collaboration.

    * How is this tool working well?

    * Are there any pain points?

* Document all reflections and action items in a shared space where everyone can refer back to them.

* Don’t be discouraged by problems that arise from managing projects in distributed teams -- write down your learnings and make adjustments as necessary.
